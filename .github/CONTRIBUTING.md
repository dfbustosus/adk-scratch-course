## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- A text editor or IDE

### Local Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/adk-scratch-course.git
   cd adk-scratch-course
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**

   make lint
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- **Import Sorting**: Use isort
- **Type Hints**: Required for all public functions and methods
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public APIs

### Code Quality Tools

The following tools are used to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pytest**: Testing
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks

### Running Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run all linting
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Run all checks
make check
```

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feature/add-new-lesson-content`
- `bugfix/fix-import-error`
- `docs/update-readme`
