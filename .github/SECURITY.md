## Reporting a Vulnerability

The ADK Scratch Course team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send details to: [security@example.com]
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Use our PGP key for sensitive information: [PGP Key ID]

3. **Private Issue**
   - Contact a maintainer directly for a private disclosure

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions, platforms, configurations
- **Fix**: Any potential fixes or mitigations you've identified

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 2 business days
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Varies based on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using this course and its examples:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update Python packages
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies
   - Use dependency scanning tools

2. **Environment Security**
   - Don't commit secrets or API keys
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement proper access controls

3. **Code Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use secure coding practices
   - Follow authentication best practices
   - Implement proper error handling

### For Contributors

When contributing to this project:

1. **Secure Development**
   - Follow OWASP guidelines
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Implement security-focused code reviews
   - Test for common vulnerabilities

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
   - Use known-good sources for packages
   - Regularly audit dependencies
   - Pin versions for reproducible builds

3. **Documentation Security**
   - Don't include sensitive information in examples
   - Use placeholder values for credentials
   - Document security considerations
   - Provide security guidance for users

## Vulnerability Types

We are particularly interested in reports about:

### High Priority
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Exposure of sensitive data

### Medium Priority
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Session management issues
- Insecure direct object references

### Lower Priority
- Rate limiting issues
- Missing security headers
- Information leakage through error messages
- Outdated dependencies (unless exploitable)

## Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Type checking prevents injection attacks
- Input length limits prevent buffer overflows

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure token management
- Role-based access control
- Session security best practices

### Data Protection
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Secure communication protocols
- Regular security updates

### Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Anomaly detection
- Regular security audits

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

1. **Acknowledge** your report within 2 business days
2. **Keep you informed** about our progress
3. **Credit you** in our security advisories (if desired)
4. **Coordinate** disclosure timing with you
5. **Not pursue legal action** against good-faith security researchers

### Hall of Fame
